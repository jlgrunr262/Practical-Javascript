# Practical-Javascript

This is the creation of a todo List project from the Watch and Code website. Gordon Zhu is the teacher 
(gordon@watchandcode.com).

It takes a much different appraoch to teaching. First, he makes a case that most of what we will be doing in 
all oour coding is similar to a todo list. Second, he starts with five requirements for the todo list. Third, he starts to 
teach coding not by reviewing features, but by satisfying the five requirements. With each release he addresses new aspects of 
the five requirements and improves the code with each version. By writing the code and having him explain it, you learn the 
way to code and the elements faster. It is not just reading through a typical book that introduces an new element of coding and 
then shows examples. Fourth, by going through multiple versions to get to a final product, he is also showing how coding is
dynamic and it represents a CI/CD pipeline. You don't just learn how to use javascript, you learn how to approach a problem by 
starting with requirements (user stories) and then going through multiple passes to improve how you satisfy the requirements. 

It is a course worth listening to several times.
